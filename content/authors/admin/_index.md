Sharath Chandra Guntuku is an Assistant Professor (Research) in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. His research aims to leverage large-scale social media image, text, and sensor data to model social health outcomes and psychological traits. I use machine learning, statistical analysis, natural language processing, and computer vision to answer questions pertaining to health and psychology in individuals and communities.

He is affiliated as a research scientist at the Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health and works closely with the World Well Being Project at the Positive Psychology Center.
