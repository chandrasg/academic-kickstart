I am an Assistant Professor (Research) in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. My research focuses on building predictive models for and uncovering insight into health outcomes and psychological states of individuals and communities. 

I develop computational models utilizing large-scale user-generated text, image, and mobile sensor data to answer questions pertaining to geospatial, cross-cultural, and temporal aspects of human behavior. My recent work investigates the manifestation of conditions such as loneliness, ADHD, stress, and depression on social media platforms and the role of heterogeneity in the digital behaviors of individuals across cultures. The resulting insights have the potential to supplement clinical diagnoses, facilitate early and personalized interventions, and improve treatments. 

As a part of the Penn COVID Hub iniative, we have been tracking mental health, common topics of discussion across states, and symptom mentions using Twitter language [[Dashboard]](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/abb41818160d4cec91f604520a088349)
